Personal Homebrew Tap
=====================

This a [Homebrew Tap](http://docs.brew.sh/brew-tap.html) containing a collection of formulas/casks that have not yet been accepted into the mainline Homebrew/Caskroom repo.

## Getting started

First, add this tap to Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap thegiantbeast/tap
```

Then you can install these formulas/cask as if there were in canonical Homebrew/Caskroom repository:

```bash
brew cask install expressvpn
```
